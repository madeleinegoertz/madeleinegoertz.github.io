I am a student in the [blended BS/MS mathematics degree program](https://math.calpoly.edu/degree-blended) at [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/). I have broad mathematical interests, ranging from algebraic topology to theoretical computer science. I am grateful to be supported by a [Frost Research Scholarship](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/prospective-students/frost-fund/frost-scholarship) in the [Philip and Christina Bailey College of Science and Mathematics](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/). I am very passionate about mathematics communication. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors of the beautiful central coast of California.
