Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [mathematics department](https://math.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). In 2025, I graduated from the [blended BS/MS mathematics degree program](https://math.calpoly.edu/degree-blended) at [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/), where I was a [Frost Research Scholar](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/prospective-students/frost-fund/frost-scholarship) in the [Bailey College of Science and Mathematics](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/). I have broad mathematical interests, ranging from algebraic topology to theoretical computer science. I am very passionate about mathematics communication. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors of the beautiful coast of California.

[Here is my CV.](/assets/cv/mgoertz-cv-web.pdf)


- [On Diffeomorphism Groups of Surfaces](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/3005/). (Master's Thesis). [Slides available here](assets\ms-defense-slides-web.pdf). I made this presentation entirely in [IPE](https://ipe.otfried.org/), inspired by [this helpful blog post](https://olejorik.github.io/post/ipe_presentation_template/).
- [On Moduli Spaces of Triangles](assets\mg-senior-project.pdf). (Senior Project).


## Research

I have conducted research into moduli spaces of triangles with [Eric Brussel](https://math.calpoly.edu/eric-brussel), funded by the Frost Fund in the Cal Poly Bailey College. I have also conducted research into Gray codes, a subject at the intersection of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, with [Aaron Williams](https://sites.google.com/williams.edu/aaron) as part of the [NSF SMALL REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/).
