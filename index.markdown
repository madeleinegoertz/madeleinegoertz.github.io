I am a student in the [blended BS/MS mathematics degree program](https://math.calpoly.edu/degree-blended) at [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/). Starting August 2025, I will be a PhD student in mathematics at UC Berkeley. I have broad mathematical interests, ranging from algebraic topology to theoretical computer science. I am grateful to be supported by a [Frost Research Scholarship](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/prospective-students/frost-fund/frost-scholarship) in the [Philip and Christina Bailey College of Science and Mathematics](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/). I am very passionate about mathematics communication. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors of the beautiful central coast of California.

## Research

I have conducted research into moduli spaces of triangles with [Eric Brussel](https://math.calpoly.edu/eric-brussel), funded by the Frost Fund in the Cal Poly Bailey College. I have also conducted research into Gray codes, a subject at the intersection of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, with [Aaron Williams](https://sites.google.com/williams.edu/aaron) as part of the [NSF SMALL REU](https://math.williams.edu/small/).
